Finally got a bit more understanding for AfterNextRender, it turns out while it listens application wide for changes, its change detection is only limited to its caller constructor or parent component. 
adding lifecycle component, which is initialized and destroyed upon clicking a button barely triggered the afterNextRender function hook.
